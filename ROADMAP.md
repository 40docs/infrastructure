## Current Release: v1.0.0-single-nva ‚úÖ

**Status**: Stable, Production-Ready  
**Architecture**: Single FortiWeb NVA (non-HA)  
**Applications**: docs, dvwa  
**Deployment**: Successful with ~100 Azure resources  

---

## Next Release: v1.1.0-fortiweb-ha üöß

**Target**: Q4 2024 / Q1 2025  
**Focus**: High Availability FortiWeb Implementation  

### üéØ Primary Objectives
- [ ] **Multi-Zone HA**: Deploy FortiWeb instances across Azure Availability Zones
- [ ] **Load Balancing**: Implement Azure Standard Load Balancer for traffic distribution
- [ ] **Failover Automation**: Automated failover mechanisms for seamless redundancy
- [ ] **State Synchronization**: FortiWeb configuration sync between instances

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### HA Architecture Changes
```
Current: Single NVA (10.0.0.36)
Target:  HA Pair
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Primary NVA: 10.0.0.37 (Zone 1)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Secondary NVA: 10.0.0.38 (Zone 2) 
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ VIP Management: 10.0.0.39-10.0.0.50
```

#### Required Modifications
1. **Terraform Resources**
   - [ ] Enable `hub_nva_high_availability = true`
   - [ ] Configure multi-zone availability sets ‚Üí availability zones
   - [ ] Implement Azure Standard Load Balancer
   - [ ] Update network interface configurations

2. **Networking Updates**
   - [ ] Expand internal subnet if needed (current: /27 = 30 IPs)
   - [ ] Configure floating IPs for failover
   - [ ] Update routing tables for HA scenarios
   - [ ] DNS failover configuration

3. **FortiWeb Configuration**
   - [ ] HA cluster setup and sync
   - [ ] Heartbeat and health checking
   - [ ] Configuration synchronization
   - [ ] License management for HA pair

### üîç Investigation Required

#### Current Blockers from Previous Attempts
- [ ] **NIC Attachment Conflicts**: Resolve network interface attachment issues
- [ ] **Resource Name Conflicts**: Implement unique naming with random suffixes
- [ ] **Lifecycle Management**: Aggressive recreation rules for HA resources
- [ ] **State Conflicts**: Clean state management during HA transitions

#### Azure Documentation Research
- [ ] **Availability Zones**: Best practices for NVA deployment across zones
- [ ] **Load Balancer**: Standard LB configuration for NVA traffic
- [ ] **Network Security**: NSG rules for HA heartbeat traffic
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Health probes and failover detection

### üß™ Testing Strategy
1. **Development Phase**
   - [ ] Create HA test environment
   - [ ] Validate failover scenarios
   - [ ] Performance testing under load
   
2. **Integration Testing**
   - [ ] Application connectivity during failover
   - [ ] SSL/TLS certificate handling
   - [ ] GitOps workflow continuity

3. **Production Readiness**
   - [ ] Disaster recovery testing
   - [ ] Rollback procedures
   - [ ] Documentation updates

### üìã Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] **Current Infrastructure**: Ensure v1.0.0 is stable and documented
- [ ] **Resource Planning**: Calculate additional Azure costs for HA
- [ ] **Team Alignment**: Coordinate with stakeholders on HA requirements
- [ ] **Backup Strategy**: Document rollback to single NVA if needed

## Future Releases

### v1.2.0-enhanced-monitoring (Future)
- [ ] Enhanced observability with custom dashboards
- [ ] Advanced alerting and notification systems  
- [ ] Performance metrics and SLA monitoring
- [ ] Security event correlation and response

### v1.3.0-multi-region (Future)
- [ ] Cross-region disaster recovery
- [ ] Global load balancing
- [ ] Multi-region data replication
- [ ] Compliance and data residency

## Development Notes

### Lessons Learned from v1.0.0
1. **Azure IP Reservations**: Always account for first 4 + last IP reservations
2. **State Management**: Implement comprehensive cleanup for orphaned resources
3. **Resource Conflicts**: Use lifecycle management for existing resources
4. **Incremental Development**: Start with working single instance before HA

### Best Practices Established
- Git tagging for stable releases
- Comprehensive testing before HA implementation
- Documentation-first approach for complex changes
- Terraform state cleanup automation

### HA Implementation Strategy
Given the complexity observed in previous HA attempts, the approach for v1.1.0 will be:
1. **Research Phase**: Deep dive into Azure HA networking patterns
2. **Prototype**: Small-scale HA testing environment  
3. **Incremental**: Step-by-step HA feature implementation
4. **Validation**: Extensive testing before production deployment

**Success Criteria**: HA deployment with zero-downtime failover and full application availability during NVA maintenance or failure scenarios.
