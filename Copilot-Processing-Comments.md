# Copilot Processing: Remove Commented Code from Terraform Files

## User Request Details
- **Task**: Analyze and remove commented code from Terraform files
- **Safety Check**: Determine if commented sections are safe to remove
- **Scope**: All *.tf files in the infrastructure repository
- **Goal**: Clean up codebase by removing unnecessary commented code

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Scan spoke-k8s_cluster.tf for commented sections
- [x] Scan all other *.tf files for commented code
- [x] Categorize found commented sections
- [x] Document findings and safety assessment

### Phase 2: Safety Assessment - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Evaluate commented resource blocks
- [x] Check commented configuration alternatives
- [x] Verify production impact assessment
- [x] Create removal plan

### Phase 3: Cleanup Execution - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Remove safe commented code blocks
- [x] Preserve essential documentation comments
- [x] Validate terraform configuration
- [x] Run terraform fmt and validate

## Findings and Actions Taken

### Commented Code Removed:
1. **spoke-k8s_cluster.tf**:
   - ✅ Removed commented `data "http" "myip"` block (unused IP detection)
   - ✅ Removed large `null_resource "tag_node_resource_group"` block (alternative tagging approach, 40+ lines)
   - ✅ Removed `azurerm_monitor_data_collection_rule` and association blocks (disabled monitoring, 35+ lines)

2. **hub-nva.tf**:
   - ✅ Removed commented managed disk resources (optional log disk feature, 15+ lines)

### Documentation Comments Preserved:
- All header comments with file descriptions
- Section dividers (===============================================================================)
- Inline explanatory comments for complex configurations
- Resource description comments

### Safety Verification:
- ✅ **terraform validate**: Configuration is valid after cleanup
- ✅ **terraform fmt**: No formatting issues
- ✅ **tflint**: No linting violations introduced
- ✅ **Production Impact**: None - all removed code was unused/disabled

## Summary

Successfully removed **~100 lines** of commented/unused Terraform code while preserving all essential documentation. The cleanup improves code readability and maintainability without affecting functionality.

### Benefits Achieved:
- **Reduced Clutter**: Removed unused resource definitions
- **Improved Readability**: Cleaner, more focused code
- **Better Maintainability**: No confusion between active/inactive resources
- **Quality Assurance**: All validation and linting passes clean

## Status
- **Current Phase**: ✅ ALL PHASES COMPLETE
- **Progress**: 100% - Commented code cleanup successful
- **Quality Gates**: ✅ terraform validate, ✅ tflint clean, ✅ terraform fmt clean
- **Production Ready**: ✅ Yes - No functional impact, cleaner codebase
